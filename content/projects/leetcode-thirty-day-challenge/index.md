Leetcode is organising a [thirty day challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/) where
participants will be given a new problem statement every day, and they are expected to solve them that very day.

In this challenge, I am planning to polish my kotlin skills. What I am planning is to solve each question daily in kotlin.
This will familiarise me with the basics of kotlin and maybe I'll end up liking kotlin and make it my official 
competitive programming language. ðŸ¤” 

Codeforces before had also hosted a series of kotlin only challenges. So I felt it could be a good time to give 
kotlin a trial run for Algo/DS related challenges. ðŸ¤“

In this project, I'll aim to solve each of those questions every day in kotlin and possibly give some insights too. ðŸ¤ž
